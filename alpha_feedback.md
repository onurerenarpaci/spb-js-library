Great job!

<ins>Library features and functionality:</ins> definitely a great library and it's well implemented. I see you have mentioned some customization options near the end of your report, which surely sound interesting. Maybe also think about animations beyond just bars - how else can you display progress? It would have been easier to judge this if the example page (which I discuss below) had more content. However I gave you 4/5 which means you have shown evidence of critical thinking and creativity.

<ins>Example page:</ins> we were expecting some descriptions alongside multiple examples. For instance, you can briefly discuss an example, show the Javascript code that originates it, and then show the result. Then do this for several different examples. One suggestion is to check online how some popular libraries display their examples. Still, you have received half marks for deploying and showing the library in action, but the example page requires a lot of work for the next submission.

<ins>Next steps and challenges:</ins> next steps were discussed, but not challenges.
